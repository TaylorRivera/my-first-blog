    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>   Hey! I'm Taylor Rivera.  I'm 16 years old.  My family's Venezuelan and Puerto Rican, but I was born in Miami, Flroida.  I like to play the piano, binge watching shows on netflix, going to the beach with my friends, and my dog Mickey.  I don't like waking up early, and I really dislike pickles, yuck!  My goals for the future include studying to become an aerospace engineer and to work for NASA.  I've always had a love for space, and decided that I want to spend the rest of my life building rocket ships and satelites to go to space.  Something cool to know about me is that I've been playing piano for six years, and I attempted to learn Greek and French for two years.  My favorite subject in school is math.  Some students don’t like math because of their teachers or they just don’t understand.  If all teachers took their time to make sure each and every student feels comfortable and understands a concept then kids will love it.  However, math can be quite difficult at times, but their will has to be strong to understand everything because if there’s a will there’s a way.  </p>
